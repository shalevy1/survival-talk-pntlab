# survival-talk-pntlab
Talk on best practices for survival analysis given at the Mayo Clinic Precision Neurotheraputics Lab (Summer 2019). 

## TODO
* Make notebook

## Goals
The talk is meant to introduce non-statisticians to 
several topics needed for survival analyis including:
* Multivariable regression strategies
* Do's and don'ts of variable selection
* Maximizing sample size with imputation
* Interpretation and reporting of statistical results
* Awareness of problems with observational data (covariate imbalance, confounding etc)

## Dislaimer
Neither Tomas Bencomo nor Kyle W. Singleton are PhD statisticians, but
we both use statistics in our work as biomedical researchers.
Kyle has a PhD in biomedical informatics, and Tomas is a computer science major 
specializing in biomedical computation. 
This presentation is not meant to be the authoritative source on any topic, but rather
a brief overview for people without much statistical training to help better
understand the biomedical literature and avoid obvious statistical errors 
during analysis.

## Ideas and Examples
The talk focuses on general ideas researchers need to be aware of as they conduct survival
analysis. A case study of (INSERT CASE STUDY HERE) with `R` examples can be found in the
`R` Markdown notebook.
