# survival-talk-pntlab
Talk on best practices for survival analysis given at the Mayo Clinic Precision Neurotheraputic Lab (Summer 2019). 

## TODO
* Decide which example to use for confounding
* Add final graphics
* Decide on ordering of slides - maybe move feature selection earlier?
* Make notebook

## Goals
The talk is meant to introduce non-statisticians to several topics including:
* Using multivariable regression strategies instead of relying on Kaplan Meier curves
* Raise awareness of observational study issues like covariate imbalance and confounding
* Do and don'ts of variable selection
* How to maximize sample size with imputation
* Proper interpretation and reporting of statistical results

## Ideas and Examples
The talk focuses on general ideas researchers need to be aware of as they conduct survival
analysis. A case study of (INSERT CASE STUDY HERE) with `R` examples can be found in the
`R` Markdown notebook.
