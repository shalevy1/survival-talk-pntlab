## Hypothesis Testing Evaluates Evidence

Procedure:

1. Determine null hypothesis $H_0$
2. Choose effect size $\beta$ of interest
3. Pick alternative hypothesis $H_1$
4. Compute p-value
5. Analyze evidence

Don't dichotomize p-value!


## Does Treatment Affect Survival?

- $H_0: \beta = 0$ Drug doesn't affect survival
- $H_1: \beta \neq 0$ Drug affects survival

```{r echo=FALSE}
data(ovarian)
ovarian.survfit <- survfit(Surv(futime, fustat) ~ rx, data = ovarian)
ggsurvplot(ovarian.survfit, data = ovarian, pval = T)
```

## Hypothesis Tests Can Make Mistakes

- False Positive: Reject $H_0$ when $H_0$ is true
- False Negative: Accept $H_0$ when $H_1$ is true

## Power Tells Us About Type II Errors

- Probability of finding a false negative
- $90%$ power is standard for preclinical experiments
- Clinical trials often want $\geq 90\%$ power
- Cohort studies often won't analyze until enough patients collected

## Confounding Creates Spurious Assocations

- Association between two variables explained by a third variable
- Ice cream sales correlated with increased drownings?
- Beware of lurking confounders like temperature!

## Experimental Design Is Critical

- Observational studies collect data without intervening
- Cohort and case control studies are observational
- Observational studies need to adjust for confounding
- Randomized experiments randomly assign patients to groups
- Phase II/III clinical trials are randomized (RCTs)
- Randomization blocks any confounding

## Statistical Goals Affect Analysis

- Estimation focuses on estimating $\beta$'s
- Effects estimation used in clinical trials
- Prediction tries to make guesses about future events
- Prediction modeling used for biomarker development and risk prediction

## Time to Event Analysis

- Many diseases don't have immediate outcomes i.e. cancer
- Tracking time to event adds extra info that increases power
- Cover censoring
