## Statistics Review

- Power - Probability of incorrectly accepting $H_0$ (Type II Error)
- $\alpha$ - Probability of incorrectly rejecting $H_0$ (Type I Error)
- Observational study
- Randomized Trial

## Survival Analysis

- Many diseases don't have immediate outcomes i.e. cancer
- Tracking time to event adds extra info that increases power

## Censoring

- Some patients lost to follow-up
